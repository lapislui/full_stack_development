# Project Workflows

This project includes several GitHub Actions workflows to automate various tasks. Below is a summary of each workflow and how to use them:

## Python Package Publish Workflow

This workflow (`.github/workflows/python-publish.yml`) uploads a Python package to PyPI when a release is created.

### How to Use:
1. Create a new release on GitHub.
2. The workflow will automatically build the distribution and upload it to PyPI.

### Additional Steps:
- Ensure you have a `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` file configured for your package.
- Add your PyPI credentials to the repository secrets.

## Pylint Workflow

This workflow (`.github/workflows/pylint.yml`) runs Pylint on your codebase to check for coding standards and errors.

### How to Use:
1. Push your code to the repository.
2. The workflow will automatically run Pylint on all `.py` files.

### Additional Steps:
- Customize the Pylint configuration by adding a `.pylintrc` file to your repository.

## Labeler Workflow

This workflow (`.github/workflows/label.yml`) automatically labels pull requests based on the files changed.

### How to Use:
1. Create a `.github/labeler.yml` file with your label configuration.
2. Open a pull request.
3. The workflow will automatically apply the appropriate labels.

### Additional Steps:
- Define your label rules in the `.github/labeler.yml` file.

## Django CI Workflow

This workflow (`.github/workflows/django.yml`) runs tests for a Django project.

### How to Use:
1. Push your code to the `main` branch or open a pull request.
2. The workflow will automatically run the tests defined in your Django project.

### Additional Steps:
- Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file with all necessary dependencies.
- Customize the test command if needed.

## Additional Suggestions

- **Add More Tests**: Enhance your test coverage by adding more unit and integration tests.
- **Code Coverage**: Integrate a code coverage tool like `coverage.py` to measure the effectiveness of your tests.
- **Continuous Deployment**: Set up a workflow for continuous deployment to automatically deploy your application after successful tests.
- **Security Scans**: Add a workflow to run security scans on your codebase using tools like `Bandit` or `Snyk`.

Feel free to customize these workflows to better suit your project's needs.
